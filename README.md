#Bank System

ğŸš€ Bank System Project << C++

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, a Bank System application built using C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, and Vectors for data management. This project simulates a real-world banking system with three main modules: Client, Employee, and Admin, each with unique functionalities.

Key Features:

ğŸ”´ Client Module:

âœ…Login using ID and password.

âœ…Deposit, withdraw, and check balance.

âœ…Transfer money to other clients.

âœ…Validation for name, password, and minimum balance (1500).

ğŸ”´ Employee Module:

âœ…Login using ID and password.

âœ…Add new clients, search for clients, and list all clients.

âœ…Edit client information (name, password, balance).

âœ…Display employee info and manage client data.

ğŸ”´Admin Module:

âœ…Inherits all Employee functionalities.

âœ…Add new employees, search for employees, and list all employees.

âœ…Edit employee information (name, password, salary).

ğŸ”´Technical Implementation:

âœ…OOP Concepts: Used inheritance (e.g., Client, Employee, and Admin classes inherit from a base Person class) and encapsulation.

âœ…File Handling: Stored client, employee, and admin data in text files (Clients.txt, Employee.txt, Admin.txt).

âœ…Data Structures: Utilized vectors for managing and retrieving data.

âœ…Validation Class: Created a reusable Validation class for input validation (e.g., name, password, balance, salary).

âœ…ASCII Art: Added a creative touch by drawing "Welcome" and "Bank System" using ASCII art in the console.

ğŸ”´Phases of Development:

âœ…Phase 1: Implemented the core classes (Client, Employee, Admin) with setter/getter methods and validation.

âœ…Phase 2: Added file handling to save and retrieve data, and created a FileManager class to manage file operations.

âœ…Phase 3: Developed a user-friendly interface with menus for clients, employees, and admins, including login and logout functionality.

ğŸ”´Tools & Technologies:

âœ…C++: Core programming language.

âœ…OOP: Inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.

âœ…File Handling: Persistent storage of data in text files.

âœ…Data Structures: Vectors for efficient data management.

âœ…ASCII Art: Enhanced user experience with creative visuals.

ğŸ”´This project was a great opportunity to apply OOP principles, file handling, and data structures in a real-world scenario. It also helped me improve my problem-solving and debugging skills in C++.
