🚀 Bank System Project - C++
I’m excited to share my latest project, a Bank System application built using C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, and Vectors for data management. This project simulates a real-world banking system with three main modules: Client, Employee, and Admin, each with unique functionalities.

Key Features:
1- Client Module:

#Login using ID and password.

#Deposit, withdraw, and check balance.

#Transfer money to other clients.

#Validation for name, password, and minimum balance (1500).

2- Employee Module:

#Login using ID and password.

#Add new clients, search for clients, and list all clients.

#Edit client information (name, password, balance).

#Display employee info and manage client data.

3- Admin Module:

#Inherits all Employee functionalities.

#Add new employees, search for employees, and list all employees.

#Edit employee information (name, password, salary).

##Technical Implementation:
1- OOP Concepts: Used inheritance (e.g., Client, Employee, and Admin classes inherit from a base Person class) and encapsulation.

2- File Handling: Stored client, employee, and admin data in text files (Clients.txt, Employee.txt, Admin.txt).

3- Data Structures: Utilized vectors for managing and retrieving data.

4- Validation Class: Created a reusable Validation class for input validation (e.g., name, password, balance, salary).

5- ASCII Art: Added a creative touch by drawing "Welcome" and "Bank System" using ASCII art in the console.

Phases of Development:
Phase 1: Implemented the core classes (Client, Employee, Admin) with setter/getter methods and validation.

Phase 2: Added file handling to save and retrieve data, and created a FileManager class to manage file operations.

Phase 3: Developed a user-friendly interface with menus for clients, employees, and admins, including login and logout functionality.

Tools & Technologies:
C++: Core programming language.

OOP: Inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.

File Handling: Persistent storage of data in text files.

Data Structures: Vectors for efficient data management.

ASCII Art: Enhanced user experience with creative visuals.

This project was a great opportunity to apply OOP principles, file handling, and data structures in a real-world scenario. It also helped me improve my problem-solving and debugging skills in C++.
